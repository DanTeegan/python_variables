# print(" Hello world ")

# Let's create a variable

# x = 10  # Type of integer
# y = 3.6 # Type of float (Decimal)
# name = "Sparta" # Type of string
#
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(name)
# print(x + y)
#
# # Built in method called type()
#
# print(type(name)) # Returns the type of data in this case it is a string
#
# print( x + name ) # You cannot add together data types of string and int

#print(str(x) + name) # You must convert the INT into a string using the str() function. This is known as casting.

# age = 99
# NHS = 1231312
# name = input("Please enter your name")
# salary = 50000

# name = input(" Please enter your name ")
# age = input(" Please enter your age ")
# print(name)
# print(age)

# Overwriting a variable
# name = "James"
# print(name)
# name = "bond"
# print(name)

# Exercise

# create a variable called first_name and last_name
# create a variable called full_name and display full_name

first_name = input("Please enter your first name")
last_name = input("Please enter your last name")
full_name = (first_name + last_name)
age = input("Please enter your age")
adress = input("Please enter your adress")

print(full_name)
