## 4 pillars of object oriented programming
### - Abstraction
### - Inheritance
### - Polymorphism
### - Encapsulation

### Abstraction

```bash
when using methods in our code

def bark(self):
    return "Woof"

print(fido.bark())
outcome - Woof
```

### Inheritance

Animal - from animals class inherited:
They inherited all attributes and functionalities

snake inherited everything from the Animal class.
```
from animal import Animal

def __init__(self)
        super.init() # This refers to the parent/base class
snake(Animal)
print(animal.sleep())
```

### Polymorphism
```bash
We can inherite as well as override particular atributes or behaviours without affecting the parent class


```
### Encapsulation
Making a varible or even methods private to hide various aspects of the class from a user.
